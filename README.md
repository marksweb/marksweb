### Hi there, I'm Mark ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m generally working on **django** projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how best to design and deploy a **django-cms** application utilising the sites framework
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **anything intertesting**.


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>You're visitor number</td>
  </tr
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://gh-marksweb-counter.glitch.me/count.svg" alt="" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

That comes from a sqlite db, counted by a [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) application.

The application which was created by [ryanlanciaux](https://github.com/ryanlanciaux) who wrote about it on [dev.to](https://dev.to/ryanlanciaux/quick-github-profile-visit-counter-14en). I just added support for sqlite to hopefully create a persistent count.
